# zettel_schema
Schema repository for zettel.io documents.

Zettel.io provides a solution as to how to manage notes, papers, slips without regard to the tool or editor used to create them. It is a set of repositories, both public and private, that stores and indexes content and does so with the lowest barrier to entry.

Zettel.io will not have a client editor or creator of notes, it will not interfere in the layout or formatting of notes published to it.

Zettel.io will have a viewer and a set of query languages. Zettel.io will publish a set of APIs for publishing, managing and querying notes.

Services, tools, organisations and individuals can publish notes to Zettel.io. Any public note or set of notes can be published by anyone to Zettel.io. Publishers need to be authenticated.
